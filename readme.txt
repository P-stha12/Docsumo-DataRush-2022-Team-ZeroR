Platform used for executing code: Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel

The code is very unmanaged. So, to save you some time, we present you:

"Time Saver dot txt"

Data:
	locus.csv -> train
	validation.csv and test.csv -> as the name implies.

Models:
	Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes
	All of them take about 20 minutes to train.

	Logistic Regression won.
	
	We also tried Neural Networks with very little success.
	We tried different variations with CNN and LSTM. Because the
	preprocessing steps took eternity, we changed the model
	architechture in the same file. So, only the last variation is
	available at Models/mental.ipynb.

			 Thank you.
